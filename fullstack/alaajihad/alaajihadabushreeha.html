    <!-- Animal Species -->
   <p> <h2>Animal Species:</h2> Domestic Cat (Felis catus)</p>

    <!-- Reproduction Method -->
    <p><h2>Reproduction Method:</h2>  Cats, specifically domestic cats, reproduce sexually. The female cat (queen) goes through heat cycles, during which she becomes receptive to mating. Male cats (tomcats) mate with the female to fertilize her eggs internally. After fertilization, the female cat gestates the embryos, typically for about 63 to 65 days, before giving birth to a litter of kittens. The kittens are born blind and entirely dependent on their mother for care and nourishment.</p>

    <!-- Animal Species -->
   <p> <h2>Animal Species:</h2> Eastern Gray Squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis)</p>

    <!-- Reproduction Method -->
    <p><h2>Reproduction Method:</h2> Squirrels, like the Eastern Gray Squirrel, reproduce sexually. During the mating season, male and female squirrels engage in mating behavior. After mating, the female squirrel typically gestates for about 44 days before giving birth to a litter of baby squirrels (kits or kittens). The newborn squirrels are born blind and hairless, and they rely on their mother for care and nourishment.</p>
 <h1>Frog Information</h1>

    <!-- Animal Species -->
   <p> <h2>Animal Species:</h2> Common Frog (Rana temporaria)</p>

    <!-- Reproduction Method -->
    <p><h2>Reproduction Method:</h2> Frogs, like the Common Frog, reproduce through external fertilization. During the breeding season, male frogs attract females with their croaking calls. Once a female is attracted, the male mounts her and releases sperm, which fertilizes the eggs that the female releases into the water. These eggs develop into tadpoles, which go through a metamorphic process to become adult frogs.</p>
